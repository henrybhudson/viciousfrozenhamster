This repository is dedicated to DurHack 2023. We are tackling the BidFX challenge to create an app to help students budget their money more effectively.

Named HamsterWallet after the randomly generated team name we were given. The app relays to the student their weekly expenses based off spendings they've inputted. These spending are categorised by AI (GPT-4) and displayed in the donut chart on the main page. This way a student can easily track weekly expenses and budget the remaining money they have.

The app also features a login and registration system which communicates with a database to allow the user to login in and register. 

If we were to continue with this, we would like the user to link their bank transactions and automatically categorise these transactions so that the user wouldn't have to enter these manually.

## Usage (Please Read)
> :warning: **Please use a mobile browser. This is only intended for mobile use** You can also use the responsive mode in developer tools on desktop.

Use the demo account `demo@durhack.com` with password `demodurhack` or create your own.

To run the code, navigate to `hamsterwallet/` and run `python manage.py runserver`. You may need Django, OpenAI and Python downloaded.

**Please contact us if you require one of our devices to run the code**.

We weren't sure how to hide the API Key for OpenAI. Please let us know if you can't add transactions (this'll be due to the key). We stored it in a `.env` file and added that in the `.gitignore` file. (Table 21 in Orion, or at henry.b.hudson@durham.ac.uk).
