This repository is dedicated to DurHack 2023. We are tackling the BidFX challenge to create an app to help students budget their money more effectively.

Named HamsterWallet after the randomly generated team name we were given. The app relays to the student their weekly expenses based off spendings they've inputted. These spending are categorised by AI (GPT-4) and displayed in the donut chart on the main page. This way a student can easily track weekly expenses and budget the remaining money they have.

The app also features a login and registration system which communicates with a database to allow the user to login in and register. 

If we were to continue with this, we would like the user to link their bank transactions and automatically categorise these transactions so that the user wouldn't have to enter these manually.
